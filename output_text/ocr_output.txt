This dataset consists of more than four hundred thousand handwritten names collected through charity projects
to support disadvantaged children around the world.
Optical Character Recognition (OcR) utilizes image processing technologies to convert characters on scanned
documents into digital forms. It typically performs well in machine printed fonts. However, it still poses a difficult
challenges for machines to recognize handwritten characters, because of the huge variation in individual writing
styles.
There are 206,799 first names and 207,024 surnames in total. The data was divided into a training set (331,059),
testing set (41,382), and validation set (41,382) respectively.
Labels of all images created via human-in-the-loop anotation on the Appen platform are also provided, enabling
vou to extend the data set with your own data.
